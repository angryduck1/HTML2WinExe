<h1>HTML2WinExe</h1>

<h2>What is it like?</h2>
The most basic html code converter to an executable file (exe)

# Request libraries:
* `tkinter`
* `tkhtmlview`
* `bs4`

# How to use?
1) Download project
2) Extract project
3) Install python (bro, if you're reading this, I think you know that after that you're going to have to install libraries.)
4) Edit your_file.html or Insert your own (Don't forget to replace it with your file in EditHtmlElements)
5) Run `main.py` (`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`)


Periodically, the project will be supplemented in its free time
